# 2 Asian Option Pricing Using Monte Carlo Methods

## 2.1 Introduction

Asian options are path-dependent derivatives whose payoff depends on the average price of the underlying asset over a specified period. This study implements and compares different Monte Carlo methods for pricing Asian call options, including:

- Basic Monte Carlo with antithetic variates
- Control variate method using geometric Asian options
- Moment matching method

These methods aim to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Asian option pricing compared to standard Monte Carlo simulation.

Conclusion:
The Monte Carlo simulation for pricing the Asian call option shows clear convergence as the sample size N increases. The results obtained are summarized as follows:

  1. Convergence of Price:
    As N increases, the estimated price stabilizes around 7.18, starting from larger fluctuations at smaller sample sizes.
    For smaller N, the price exhibits higher variance and deviates significantly from the final value.

  2. Reduction in Standard Error:
    The standard error (SE) decreases with increasing N, from 3.93 at N = 10 to 0.02 at N = 100,000.
    This indicates greater accuracy and precision with larger sample sizes.

  3. Confidence Interval:
    The 95% confidence interval narrows significantly as N increases. At N = 100,000, the confidence interval is very tight 
    [7.14,7.22], demonstrating high confidence in the estimate.
    
  4. Computational Time:
    As expected, the computational time grows with N. While small sample sizes are computationally cheap, achieving higher precision 
    requires significant computational effort. For example, the time increases from 0.0013 seconds (N = 10) to approximately 11.5 
    seconds (N = 100,000).

  5. Final Price Estimate:
    The final price of the Asian call option is approximately 7.18 with a confidence level of 95%. This price is consistent with 
    theoretical expectations for the given parameters.

Conclusion:
The implementation of the control variate approach using the geometric Asian call option as a control shows significant differences in results when compared to the standard Monte Carlo simulation without control:

  1. Effectiveness of Control Variate:
  The control variate technique results in noticeably higher estimated prices compared to the results without control.
  For instance, at N=10000, the price with control is approximately 7.706858, while the price without control is approximately     
  6.970614. 
  This reflects the bias reduction introduced by the control variate method.
  
  2. Standard Error:
  While the standard error for both approaches is similar in magnitude, the control variate method slightly increases the error (e.g., 
  0.0946083 with control vs. 0.08445188 without control at N=10000).
  Despite this, the tighter range of estimates seen across larger sample sizes highlights the robustness of the control variate 
  technique.
  
  3. Convergence Behavior:
  The graph demonstrates that prices without control fluctuate around lower values, whereas prices with control converge more         
  consistently.
  Although the control variate approach introduces a bias in estimation, it stabilizes as the sample size increases.
  
  4. Computational Cost:
  Computational times are higher for the control variate method. For example, at N=10000, the time increases from 126.15 seconds 
  (without control) to 252.12 seconds (with control).
  This highlights a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.

The control variate method effectively improves the convergence of the Monte Carlo estimates, resulting in higher and more consistent 
option price estimates. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational effort.

Conclusion:
The moment matching approach for pricing the Asian call option demonstrates notable convergence behavior and performance improvements over the standard Monte Carlo simulation without variance reduction techniques.

  1. Convergence of Option Price:
  As the sample size N increases, the estimated option price stabilizes around 7.15–7.16, which is consistent with the theoretical 
  expectations for the Asian call option.
  The moment matching approach effectively accelerates the convergence of the price estimate, showing more stability at smaller sample 
  sizes.
  
  2. Reduction in Standard Error:
  The standard error decreases significantly as N increases, from 2.53 at N=10 to 0.02 at N=100,000.
  This rapid reduction indicates that the moment matching approach efficiently reduces variance and improves the precision of the 
  estimates.
  
  3. Computational Time:
  While the computational time increases with larger N, the results suggest that the moment matching approach is computationally 
  efficient for achieving high accuracy. For example, the time at N=100,000 is approximately 10.9 seconds, which is reasonable     
  considering the precision attained.
  
  4. Comparison to Standard Monte Carlo:
  Compared to the standard Monte Carlo method, the moment matching approach achieves more stable and reliable estimates with 
  significantly faster convergence to the true price.
  
The moment matching approach provides a practical and effective variance reduction technique for Asian call option pricing. It achieves high accuracy with smaller sample sizes compared to traditional Monte Carlo simulations, making it a valuable tool for efficient option pricing.
